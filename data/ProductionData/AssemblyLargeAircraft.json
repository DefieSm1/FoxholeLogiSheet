    "description": "The backbone of the Alliance Sky Brigade, the Harbinger excels at both strafing ground targets and dogfighting with its twin, front-facting machine guns. Not willing to be outclassed by crude Mesean engineering, Luminary-formerly a northern Caoivish industrial engineering firms-set to work on designing its Mk. I prototype. Sleek, aerodynamic, and so fast it screams, the Harbinger's design is intended to give the Nevish Alliance a psychological edge on the battlefield as much as it provides air support.",

Featuring twin torpedo bays and a rear mounted machine gun, the Man-O-War is a veritable threat to any ship's hull or would-be assailants. The M925's unique capabilities overdelivered, as it was originally conveived as nothing more than a short-range coastal defence bomber. During the M925's first operation off of the Katoman coast, a small squadron single-handedly sank a Titan. Her crew had no idea how their ship filled with seawater as torpedo after torpedo bored into the underside of her hull.",

While most paratroopers have a short lifespan, one trio that called themselves \"The Furies\" successfully completed over one hundred combat jumps into Caoivish territory. It's believed that The Furies are responsible for sabotaging countless Warden operations in the north and played a pivotal role in Legate Thea Maro's \"Operation Sunfall\".",
