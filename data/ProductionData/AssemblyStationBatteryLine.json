    "description": "A first of its kind, the Skycaller is a variation of the Niska Motor Carriage with a Rycker designed rocket battery fited in the rear bed. This unique armoured vehicle quickly fires rockets over long distances with ease, and can be rearmed and relocated at the drop of a hat. The Skycaller is the deadly result of combined Nevish and Caoivish engineering.",

    "description": "Originally designed as a mock-up for more sophisticated rocket platforms, the Jester gets its designation from the response to reckless early prototypes that were bolted onto stripped down King Spires. This unusual vehicle can fire specialized rockets over long distances. Its light frame makes it easy to reposition, but vulnerable to sabotage.",
