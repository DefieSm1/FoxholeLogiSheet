    "description": "This gargantuan beast is the brainchild of Gray Cullen. Once thought impossible, the Predator was Cullen's idea of how a great ship might operate on land. It boasts two sets of quad-barrelled grenade launches and a heavy-duty 94.5mm forward facing cannon. While limitations of ground-based travel posed certain restrictions on the scope of the project, Cullen wasn't deterred and made necessary adjustments to meet his vision of the ideal land ship.",

Rebels commandeered the first \"Ares\" Prototype, the O-75a, and turned it against Colonial forces in the region, ultimately leading to its destruction—albeit not without great effort. This event wove the great behemoth into the tapestry of Colonial legend.",
